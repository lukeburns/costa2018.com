<h1>Terms, Conditions &amp; Privacy</h1>
<h2>Your Data</h2>
<p>When you fill out forms on our website, or paper forms at our live events, we collect and store your data. This may include your name, email, phone number, address, profile photo, your policy views, and more.</p>
<p>We use your data in very simple ways.</p>
<p>We use your name and email address to correspond with you, or send you our newsletter and notifications (of course you can unsubscribe anytime).</p>
<p>We use your name, address, and other information to report your contributions to our campaign to the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) according to the laws governing congressional campaigns. Learn more at <a href="https://fec.gov">fec.gov</a>.</p>
<p>We do not share your contact information with spammers, or third parties any any kind, except the FEC as noted above.</p>
<p>We will never sell your data to anyone.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We take security very seriously.</p>
<p>We do not store your financial data (credit card number, expiration date, etc) ever! In fact your financial data never even hit our servers. They go straight from your browser to our payment processor (more info here: <a href="https://stripe.com/help/security">https://stripe.com/help/security</a>).</p>
<p>Also, all of the traffic to and from our website and your browser is encrypted (scrambled before it goes out, and unscrambled only when it gets where it's going). Notice the little padlock next to our website address in the URL bar (or the 'https' in 'https://www.costa2018.com'). That's how you know a website uses encryption to protect your data while it's being delivered.</p>

<h2>Live Events</h2>
<p>This is the fun part!</p>
<p>We will host live events, small and large, throughout the campaign, and attending them has a few implication you should be aware of. Our events are often filmed, and published online; sometimes we broadcast live as well. By attending, you are participatingâ€¦ in high definition! So, now that you know you'll be on camera, well... you know, smile : )</p>
<p>Of course, <strong>we will always respect a request to be removed or not included in videos and other digital media</strong>. The only exception is if you are a public figure. This is because privacy laws are slightly different for public figures.</p>

<h2>More Information</h2>
<p>We will be updating these terms and conditions as our campaign progresses. You can reach out to us with questions anytime! costa2018.com@gmail.com, (516) 945-9951</p>
